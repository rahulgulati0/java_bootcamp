### Switch Statement

<br />

<br />

The `switch` statement works like this: The value of the expression is compared with each of the values in the `case` statements. If a match is found, the code sequence following that case statement is executed. If none of the constants matches the value of the expression, then the `default` statement is executed. However, the default statement is optional.

If no case matches and no default is present, then no further action is taken.
The `break` statement is used inside the `switch` to terminate a statement sequence. When a `break` statement is encountered, execution branches to the first line of code that follows the entire `switch` statement. This has the effect of “jumping out” of the switch.
